# Discord Python Wordcloud Bot

Very simple self bot that searches through a channel and produces a WordCloud with every message ever sent. Also says how many messages per person were sent, the total amount of messages and average message length.  

**Note**: Using a self bot is against the Discord Community Guidelines, this repo should only be used as an educational source.
