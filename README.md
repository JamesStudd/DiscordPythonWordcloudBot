# Discord Python Wordcloud Bot

Very simple self bot that searches through a channel and produces a WordCloud with every message ever sent. Also says how many messages per person were sent, the total amount of messages and average message length.  

**Note**: Using a self bot (providing a user token) is against the Discord Community Guidelines and as such, this repo should only be used with an official bot token, or purely as an educational source.
